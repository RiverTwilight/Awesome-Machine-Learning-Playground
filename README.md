(Run Locally)

## Prerequisites:

This repo is not a beginner guide. Make sure you meet these requirements:

-   A Google account (to run the notebooks in Google Colab)
-   Basic Python programming experience
-   A foundational understanding of advanced mathematics
-   Basic proficiency in English reading

## Run on Local

The code requires `python>=3.8`. PyTorch or other framework are not needed.

```shell
py -m venv Env
./Env/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
